                Hello, I am guessing you are a classmate, a recruiter 
                who wants to know more about me and my skills, or you are generally interested in me and 
                the projects I have completed.  I am hoping you can see how much I have progressed in my 
                four years of school, and hopefully, you will be able to see what my favorite part of my 
                studies was.  If you have ever have stumbled across my Github page or Linkedin and felt 
                that it was not enough to know more about me and my skills, this page is for you. Once 
                you have toured my website, I hope you can visit my Linkedin or GitHub. 
                </p>
